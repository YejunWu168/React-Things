# React Things

A Things clone built with React-cli.

## About this project

I built this app to learn React. The application is largely based off one of my favourite todo apps on the Mac: Things. Made by the brilliant minds of https://culturedcode.com/things/.
This app is basically a Things clone but for the web.

### Things to note

This project is not complete it is still very much a work in progress and therefore not build for production yet. A lot of functionality from the original are missing and there is no database or local storage connected to the app yet.
